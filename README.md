Back to Reality
========

A boilerplate for web developers who want to make apps for stereoscopic augmented reality using three.js and WebRTC.

To get started, `npm install` and `npm run local`!

Note: Chrome requires a secure connection in order to access your device's camera! I recommend deploying to your app to test it out on other devices.

##Examples

[Camera & 3D Balls](https://backtoreality-3d.herokuapp.com/)

[Camera & HTML Element](https://backtoreality-video.herokuapp.com/)

[Camera & 3D Flamingo](https://jiheh.herokuapp.com/): only works with rear-facing cameras and with window resize
