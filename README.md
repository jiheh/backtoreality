Back to Reality
========

A boilerplate for web developers who want to make apps for stereoscopic augmented reality using three.js and getUserMedia.

To get started, `npm install` and `npm run local`!

Note: Chrome now requires a secure connection in order to access your device's camera! I recommend deploying to your app to test it out on other devices.
